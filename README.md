# Kotlin-Dice-Game-Project

**Summary:** 

For my first expericence with the Kotlin language, I attempted to create a dice mini game via Intellij IDEA. With the rules being: After entering your name and how many rounds you wish to play, there will be 3 beginning dice rolls for the computer's and player's turn. After displaying the score of those starting dice rolls, the player can choose to either roll 1 die or 2 dice. The goal is to roll to 21 or as close to 21, WITHOUT going over 21. If the player or the computer go over 21, the turn for that player will be a 0, and the next turn is automatically initiated. Whoever is the closest to 21 will win for that round, and will tally up. The best of rounds chosen to play will decide the winner of the dice game.
